    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies: “More people are becoming vulnerable to disasters or are forced to cope with acts of violence, financial crises and growing uncertainty, often without adequate support from their governments.” Disasters can be either natural or human-made events and can include pandemics, technological disasters or environmental cataclysms.<br>

        Disaster types include the following:<br>
        
        Earthquakes<br>
        Tornadoes<br>
        Hurricanes<br>
        Pandemics<br>
        
        There were 10 weather and climate-related disasters each exceeding $1 billion in losses in the U.S. within the first half of 2020, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The number of disasters resulting in billion-dollar loses has been steadily rising, from 29 disasters in the 1980s to 119 disasters in the 2010s. In addition to this increase, cascading disasters, such as a hurricane during the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforce the need for effective and ethical leadership across all sectors and levels of government.<br>
        
        Managing Disasters:<br>
        Specifically, disaster management is about organizing and directing resources to cope with a disaster and coordinating the roles and responsibilities of responders, private sector organizations, public sector agencies, nonprofit and faith-based organizations, volunteers, donations, etc. The ultimate goal of the disaster-management leader is to minimize the event’s impact, something that involves preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation.</p>

  <section id="prevention">
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>Disaster prevention and mitigation are used as synonyms. Prevention is to ensure that human action or natural phenomena do not result in disaster or emergency. Preventive activities are aimed at trying to prevent future disasters, such as planting trees on slopes to prevent landslides or a dam from controlling flooding. Prevention measures are employed to eliminate or reduce the incidence of severity. Few such measures include land use planning, preventing habitation in risk zones, disasterresistant buildings, finding ways to reduce risk even before the disaster strikes and community awareness and education.

        Mitigation along the same lines also means reducing the severity of the human and material damage caused by the disaster. It consists of efforts directed toward preventing hazardous conditions from becoming disasters or minimising their effects in the event of a disaster. Some steps generally taken under the mitigation phase include preparing building codes, demarcating hazardous zones, public awareness, and vulnerability assessment. Measures to reduce or eliminate disaster risk are the focus of the mitigation phase. There are various types of mitigation activities:<br>
        
        Structural Mitigation: <br>
        Various physical changes can be made to a structure to help mitigate structural hazards. It involves building such infrastructure which can minimise the probability of occurrence or at least reduce the intensity of the disaster when it occurs. Various measures may include reducing erosion caused by runoff, controlling sedimentations, building earthquake and wind-resistant houses, and building sandbag barriers to provide flood protection. Life and property are protected by these empirical measures.
        Structures must be prepared for the expected stresses that may result from the hazard before mitigation measures can be applied. Building a strong structure that is capable of surviving hazards is essential.<br>
        Non-Structural Mitigation:<br>
        The non-structural mitigation measures include carrying out non-physical activities (mostly policies and practices) to raise knowledge about the hazard.
        Such measures are directed towards mental preparedness, training, insurance, planning, discussion, etc. By reducing disasters’ effects indirectly, all of these measures reduce their impact. Global mitigation measures include the following tools, according to the Virtual University for the Small States of the Commonwealth (VUSSC): Hazard management and vulnerability reduction, Economic diversification, Political intervention, Public awareness.
        Activities for disaster mitigation should measure and evaluate the changing risk environment. The development of thorough, proactive tools that assist in choosing where to concentrate resources and efforts on risk reduction may be one of the activities.</p>

  <section id="response">
    <h2>Response</h2>
    <p>Disaster response refers to the actions taken directly before, during or in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The objective is to save lives, ensure health and safety and to meet the subsistence needs of the people affected.[1]: 16  This includes warning/evacuation, search and rescue, providing immediate assistance, assessing damage, continuing assistance and the immediate restoration or construction of infrastructure (i.e. provisional storm drains or diversion dams). The aim of emergency response is to provide immediate assistance to maintain life, improve health and support the morale of the affected population. Such assistance may range from providing specific but limited aid, such as assisting refugees with transport, temporary shelter, and food to establishing semi-permanent settlements in camps and other locations. It also may involve initial repairs to damage or diversion to infrastructure.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="recovery">
    <h2>Recovery</h2>
    <p>Disaster recovery (DR) is an organization’s ability to restore access and functionality to IT infrastructure after a disaster event, whether natural or caused by human action (or error). DR is considered a subset of business continuity, explicitly focusing on ensuring that the IT systems that support critical business functions are operational as soon as possible after a disruptive event occurs.

        Today, disaster recovery planning is crucial for any business, especially those operating either partially or entirely in the cloud. Disasters that interrupt service and cause data loss can happen anytime without warning—your network could have an outage, a critical bug could get released, or your business might have to weather a natural disaster. Organizations with robust and well-tested disaster recovery strategies can minimize the impact of disruptions, achieve faster recovery times, and resume core operations rapidly when things go awry. </p>
